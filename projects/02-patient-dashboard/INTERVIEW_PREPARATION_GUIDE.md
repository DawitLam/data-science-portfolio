## üîß **Technical Deep Dive Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How did you handle feature engineering for the ML models?**
**A:** *"I implemented automated feature alignment between patient data and trained models. The system dynamically detects available features, handles missing values through imputation, and ensures proper data types. When models expect specific features that aren't available, the system gracefully degrades and provides best-effort predictions while alerting users to the limitations."*

### **Q: How did you ensure the dashboard could scale for production use?**
**A:** *"I used Streamlit's caching decorators for data loading operations, implemented modular code architecture for easy maintenance, and designed the ML inference pipeline to handle multiple models simultaneously. The synthetic data approach ensures HIPAA compliance while maintaining clinical realism for demonstrations."*

### **Q: What makes this different from a typical data science dashboard?**
**A:** *"Three key differentiators: First, it integrates real-time ML predictions with clinical decision support. Second, it follows evidence-based medical protocols rather than generic analytics. Third, it provides actionable recommendations that healthcare professionals could actually use in patient care workflows."*

### **Q: How did you validate the clinical relevance of your analytics?**
**A:** *"I incorporated established medical guidelines like blood pressure classifications, age-based risk stratification protocols, and evidence-based care recommendations. The color coding follows clinical standards - green for low risk, yellow for moderate risk requiring monitoring, and red for high risk requiring immediate intervention."*

**A:** *"I'd establish validation protocols including cross-validation with held-out test sets, A/B testing for clinical outcomes, regular model retraining with new data, and collaboration with clinical experts for outcome validation. Continuous monitoring would track both technical and clinical performance metrics."*

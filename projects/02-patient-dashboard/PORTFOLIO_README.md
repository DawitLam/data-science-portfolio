## 🔬 **Technical Deep Dive**

### **ML Model Integration**
```python
# Real-time risk prediction
risk_probability = model.predict_proba(patient_features)[:, 1][0]

# Risk level classification
if risk_probability > 0.7:
    risk_level = "🔴 High Risk - Immediate Action"
elif risk_probability > 0.3:
    risk_level = "🟡 Moderate Risk - Enhanced Monitoring"
else:
    risk_level = "🟢 Low Risk - Routine Care"
```

### **Clinical Decision Logic**
```python
# Evidence-based care protocols
if risk_level == "High Risk":
    recommendations = [
        "Schedule comprehensive clinical assessment",
        "Implement enhanced monitoring protocol",
        "Consider preventive interventions"
    ]
